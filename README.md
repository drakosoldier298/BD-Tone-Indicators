#Tone indicator extras
- New tones! 
this fork was made because i was tired of having my work undone everytime an update released, and i will be adding community wanted tones, something that the orginal author said people can do manually, as they were not wanting tot ake requests.










# Tone Indicator Plugin
Tone indicators will show as little badges in messages, hovering over them will give you the definition. 
> Highlighting a tone tag and using the context menu will give you a toast with the definition of the tag
